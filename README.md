# hello-world
Its my first repository and has been made by following the "Hello world" Github tutorial.

Life is good.
I am learning Git, I have already learnt several things; python, electronics, web development, grsphic designing, guitar, photography, microcontrollers, pcb design, etc.
I never get bored do I?

Yours truly,
MasterTech
